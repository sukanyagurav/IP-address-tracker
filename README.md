## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

This challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I used [IP Geolocation API by ipgeolocation](https://ipgeolocation.io/). To generate the map, I used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- LeafletJS
